# Dataset
## NEU-DET
> This dataset was created by the team of Song Kechen from Northeastern University, focusing on the detection and recognition of surface defects in steel. The dataset contains 1800 images, covering six common types of steel surface defects, namely:
> 1. Crazing (cracks)
> 2. Inclusion
> 3. Patches
> 4. Pitted Surface
> 5. Rolled in Scale
> 6. Scratches
> Dataset structure
> The dataset is mainly divided into two parts:

> ANNOTATION: Contains label information for each image, used to label the type and location of defects.
> IMAGE: Contains 1800 images of surface defects in steel, each corresponding to a specific type of defect.
> Data Description
> Image format: All images are in standard image format, suitable for computer vision tasks.
> Tag format: The tag file provides a detailed description of the defect types and their location information in each image, facilitating object detection and classification tasks.
> Problem description
> The dataset of steel surface defects is widely used in the field of industrial inspection, especially in automated production lines, for real-time monitoring and identification of defects on the steel surface to ensure product quality. This dataset provides a standardized dataset for researchers and engineers to develop and test surface defect detection
> algorithms for steel.
